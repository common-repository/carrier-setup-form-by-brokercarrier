= What is BrokerCarrier and why do I need an account to use this plugin? =

BrokerCarrier is a SaaS platform for freight brokerages which enables purely-online vetting, onboarding, and management of their motor carrier networks. One feature of our 
service is that our customers can embed the carrier onboarding application (a series of forms and verification steps) directly into their websites by pasting in a block of 
HTML code which we provide. The BrokerCarrier plugin simplifies this process, replacing that large block of code with a simple form and a shortcode.
